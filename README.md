# leaflet-challenge

For this project, json data on all earthquakes from the past seven days were collected from http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php. That data was imported and a map was created, showcasing each earthquake, coloured by depth, and sized by the magnitutde. The colourscale for the depth is light green for -10 to 10, yellow for 10 to 30, gold for 30 - 50, orange for 50 to 70, orangered for 70 to 90, and red for 90 +. Popups were also included so, when a circle marker is pressed it will display the magnitude, location and depth of the earthquake. The legend is in the bottom-right, it shows the colourscale for the depth of the earthquakes for reference for viewer.
